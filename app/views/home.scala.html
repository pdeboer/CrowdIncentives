        Thank you for agreeing to participate in our experiment.  Our goal in this experiment is to create the best possible love story in 1 hour.  As promised in your HIT, everyone in the study receives 20 cents just for registering their user name and showing up.  An additional $16 will be awarded to the participants who help to write the best love story this hour.</p>

    <p>
        Our love story is a three part story:  Part 1 tells the story of how our characters first meet, Part 2 tells the story of their first date, and Part 3 explains what happens after and concludes.  Do they live happily ever after?</p>

    <p>
        You can participate in two ways:
    <ol>
        <li>you can write any one (or more) of the three parts of the story itself, or</li>
        <li>you can select three parts of the story to make a story submission by clicking "Create Integrated Story" below.</li>
</ol>
        At 11:00, all of the complete story submissions will be reviewed and the person who submitted the best complete story will be awarded $1.  The authors of the three parts used in that complete story submission will each receive $5.  You are welcome to write more than one part and/or make a complete submission by selecting three parts.  When you are ready, use the tabs to start.  Thank you for participating!</p>
